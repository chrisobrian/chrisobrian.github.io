# Lutron Caseta Layout Tool (For Lutron ALT Ex Project)

**The interactive tool is web-based and accessible at [cobrian59.github.io](cobrian59.github.io).**

### Purpose

This interactive tool is designed to be a lightweight and simple means for laying out a potential Lutron Caseta home setup. The purpose is twofold; this can be used by members of the electrical contractor firm to quickly "sketch" options for the consumer, or it can be used by the consumer to help them determine their own custom setup that fits their needs best.


## Instructions

This is a simple tool to use. **Click any space** in the floor map that is not being occupied by a fixture to create a new Lutron device. Devices can either be *dimmers/controllers* or *remotes*. A new device will appear as a dimmer/controller be default.

**Dimmers & Controllers** are physically connected to the circuit and provide the actual control over the fixtures. Once a dimmer has been created, click and hold to drag the "control signal" to each of the fixtures that the dimmer or controller will govern. **Dimmers and Controllers are square**.

**Remotes** are devices that can control dimmers/controllers. The remotes *do not* govern the fixtures directly. Therefore, a control signal can be dragged from a remote to a dimmer/controller only. A remote can control multiple dimmer/controllers. **Dimmers and Controllers are circles**.


### Selecting & Info Window

A device can be selected by clicking on it. Selected devices appear in yellow. While selected, press the "i" key to bring up the device's info window. This window allows you to name the device and select the device type.


### Moving & Managing Devices

The Lutron devices can be moved by using the arrow keys. The device must be selected in order to move it.

Similarly, selected devices can be deleted using the *backspace* key.
